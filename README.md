## Make Change Project
This is my week one project in Skill Distillery coding bootcamp. This project is a cash register which calculates the amount of change required, and lists the denominations necessary, from $20- $1 bills, and from .$25- $.01 coins.

### Overview
Make Change is a display of the skills and concepts learned in Skill Distillery Pre-work and Week One. 

### Topics

### How to Run
Enter an amount.
Enter the amount the customer paid.
Make Change calculates change if necessary. The program tells the user when change is exact, and prints an error message if not enough money was provided.
